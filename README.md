# APKCD //APK Combo Downloader

APKCD is a CLI tool that allows you to download APKs from APKCombo.app. This repo also provides a npm package [apkmirror-downloader](https://www.npmjs.com/package/apkmirror-downloader) that allows you to download APKs from APKMirror programatically.

This repo and project is based on [APKMD](https://github.com/tanishqmanuja/apkmirror-downloader/) by [tanishqmanuja](https://github.com/tanishqmanuja). If you want more download options, consider using this tool.

# Why a fork with a different APK provider?

APKMirror does have more APKs but recently has added Cloudflare protection which makes it harder to scrape. APKCombo is a good alternative with a lot of APKs and no Cloudflare protection.

The API and usage is the same as APKMD. You can check below for documentation on using the API and CLI.

## 🚀 Install

Using `npm`
```bash
npm install @nirewen/apkcombo-downloader
```

Using `bun`
```bash
bun add @nirewen/apkcombo-downloader
```

Or use any other package manager like `yarn` or `pnpm`

## 📃 Usage

```ts
import { APKComboDownloader } from "@nirewen/apkcombo-downloader";

const apkmd = new APKComboDownloader(
  { outDir: "./downloads" } // <-- 🟠 APKMDOptions (optional)
);

apkmd.download(
  { org: "youtube", repo: "com.google.android.youtube" }, // <-- App (required)
  { type: "apk" } // <-- 🟣 AppOptions (optional), will be merged with APKMDOptions
);

// OR

APKComboDownloader.download({ org: "youtube", repo: "com.google.android.youtube" });
```
